Clean Thesis Style

----------------------------------------
The design of this "Clean Thesis" style is inspired
by user guide documents from Apple Inc.

If you like the "Clean Thesis" style I would be very pleased about a
donation (see http://cleanthesis.der-ric.de/). If you can not or do
not want to donate then I would appreciate a POSTCARD. You can find
my address in the file Clean-Thesis.pdf. I am going to collect all
postcards and exhibit them online at http://cleanthesis.der-ric.de/.

The idea of providing my customized style for thesis documents was
motivated and inspired by the popular "A Classic Thesis Style"
developed by Andr\'e Miede (http://www.miede.de). Thanks to Andr\'e
for doing a great job.
